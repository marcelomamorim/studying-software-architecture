# Chapter 3: Modularity

### General definition

> "We use modularity to describe a logical grouping of related code, which could be a group of classes in an object-oriented language or functions in a structured or functional language.".

### Measuring Modularity

- "We focus on three key concepts: cohesion, coupling and connascence."

- Cohesion:

> "Cohesion referes to what extent the parts of a module should be contained within the same module.".

- Coupling:

> Afferent: "measures the number of incoming connections to a code artifact (component, class, function, and so on)"

> Efferent: "measures the outgoing connections to ther code artifacts."

> Instability:

I =: Ce / (Ce + Ca)

Ce =: "outgoing coupling" 
Ca =: "incoming coupling"

Essa equação representa basicamente a razão entre as conexões eferentes divididas pelo total de conexões.

- Connascence:
